This project presents the process of data preparation, research question formulation, data analysis, and data modelling with the goal of extracting insights from the **2018 PISA Dataset**. The [PISA](https://www.oecd.org/pisa/), which stands for **Programme for International Student Assessment** is a worldwide set of tests conducted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to gauge the knowledge and competence of 15-year-old students in the key subject areas of reading, mathematics, and science 

This is a major course output in a statistical modelling and simulation class under Mr. Arren C. Antioquia of the Department of Software Technology, De La Salle University.

## Task
The task is to create a Jupyter notebook that presents the process leading up to the generation of insights from a raw dataset:
- Dataset Representation
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Research Questions
- Statistical Inference
- Insights and Conclusions

The complete project specifications can be found in the document [`Project Specifications.pdf`](https://github.com/memgonzales/pisa-2018-analysis/blob/master/Project%20Specifications.pdf).

## Datasets
The following real-world data sources (one primary dataset and two auxiliary datasets) were used:

Dataset | Source
-- | --
2018 OECD PISA School Questionnaire Dataset *(Primary Dataset)* | [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dilaraahan/pisa-2018-school-questionnaire)
2018 OECD PISA Average Score of Mathematics, Science, and Reading Test Scores Dataset *(Auxiliary Dataset)* | [FactsMaps](https://factsmaps.com/pisa-2018-worldwide-ranking-average-score-of-mathematics-science-reading/)
ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 Code List *(Auxiliary Dataset)* | [ISO](https://www.iso.org/publication/PUB500001.html)
